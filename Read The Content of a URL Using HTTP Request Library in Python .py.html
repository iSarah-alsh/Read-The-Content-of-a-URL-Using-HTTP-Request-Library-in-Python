# ## 1- Libraries:
# <b>1- requests Library:</b> for making HTTP requests in Python.<br>
# <b>2- re Library:</b> regular expression library need it to print only the contect without html tags.<br>

# ## 2- HTTP request methods:

# - get( ): HTTP has 2 methods GET and POST each on determine which action you want to perform in this code I used GET method to request the data (content) from the URL.
# - content: gives you access to the raw bytes of the URL.
# - text: convert raw bytes that show in content into a string using a character encoding such as UTF-8.
# - status_code: informs you of the status of the request.
# - sub( ): replace the substrings that match with the search pattern with a string of user’s choice.
# - headers: to give a useful information such as a content type.
